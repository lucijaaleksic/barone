# Kerma: Protocol description
For this course, we will develop our own blockchain. Each student will write their own independent implementation of a node for our blockchain in their programming language of
choice. This document outlines how the system will work and how nodes will communicate.
The implementation must be resilient to simple and complex attacks. Simple attacks can be the supply of invalid data. Complex attacks can involve signatures, proof-of-work, double spending, and
blocks, all of which must be validated carefully.
The chain is a static difficulty proof-of-work UTXO-based blockchain over a TCP network protocol. 

## Cryptographic Primitives
### Hash
SHA256 is used as the hash function. This is used both for content-addressable application objects as well as proof-of-work. When hashes appear in JSON, they should be in hexadecimal
format as described in below

### Signatures
Ed25519 is used as the digital signature scheme. Public keys and signatures should be byte-encoded
as described in RFC 8032. Once a signature or public key is byte-encoded, it is converted
to hex in order to represent as a string within JSON. 

##  Application Objects
These are content-addressed by the SHA256 hash of their JSON representation. An application object is a JSON dictionary containing the type key and further keys depending on its type. There are two types of application objects: transactions and blocks. Their
objectids are called txid and blockid, respectively
### Transaction
This represents a transaction and has the type transaction. It contains the key inputs
containing an array of inputs, and the key outputs containing an array of outputs.
``` json
{
  "type":"transaction",
  "inputs":[
    {
    "outpoint":{
      "txid":"f71408bf847d7dd15824574a7cd4afdfaaa2866286910675cd3fc371507aa196",
      "index":0
    },
    "sig":"3869a9ea9e7ed926a7c8b30fb71f6ed151a132b03fd5dae764f015c98271000e7da322dbcfc97af7931c23c0fae060e102446ccff0f54ec00f9978f3a69a6f0f"
    }
  ],
  "outputs ":[
    {
    "pubkey":"077a2683d776a71139fd4db4d00c16703ba0753fc8bdc4bd6fc56614e659cde3" ,
    "value":5100000000
    }
  ]
}
```
### Block
This represents a block and has the type block. It contains the following keys: txids, which
is a list of the transaction identifiers within the block, nonce, which is a 32-byte hexified value,
previd, which is the block identifier of the previous block in the chain, created, which is an
(integer) UNIX timestamp in seconds, and T which is a 32-byte hexadecimal integer and is
the mining target. 
``` json
{
  "type":"block",
  "txids":[
    "740bcfb434c89abe57bb2bc80290cd5495e87ebf8cd0dadb076bc50453590104"
  ],
  "nonce":"a26d92800cf58e88a5ecf37156c031a4147c2128beeaf1cca2785c93242a4c8b",
  "previd":"0024839ec9632d382486ba7aac7e0bda3b4bda1d4bd79be9ae78e7e1e813ddd8",
  "created":1622825642,
  "T":"003a000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  "miner":"****",
  "note ":"A sample block"
}
```
## Messages
Every message exchanged by two peers over TCP is a JSON message. These JSON messages
are separated from one another using `’\n’`.
### Hello
You must exchange a hello message both ways before you exchange any other message. If a
message is sent prior to the hello message, you must close the connection. Messages can be
sent in any order after that.
``` json
{
  "type":"hello",
  "version":"0.8.0",
  "agent":"barone 0.8.0"
}
```
### Error
Objects with implementation-specific error messages which describe any
exceptions encountered. An error object should be of type error and contain an error key
with a string value that describes the error at hand.
``` json
{
  "type":"error" ,
  "error":"Unsupported message type received"
}
```
### GetPeers
This message has no payload and must be responded to with a peers message.
``` json
{
"type": "getpeers"
}
```
### Peers
It contains apeers key which is an array of peers. Every peer is a string in the form of <host>:<port>.

``` json
{
  "type ":" peers" ,
  "peers":[
  "****.com:18018", /* dns */
  "138.197.191.170:18018", /* ipv4 */
  "[fe80 : : f03c:91 ff : fe2c:5a79]:18018" /* ipv6 */
  ]
}
```
### GetObject
This message requests an object addressed by the given hash. It contains an objectid key
which is the address of the object.
``` json
{
  "type":"getobject" ,
  "objectid":"0024839ec9632d382486ba7aac7e0bda3b4bda1d4bd79be9ae78e7e1e813ddd8"
}
```
### IHaveObject
This message advertises that the sending peer has an object with a given hash addressed by
the objectid key.
``` json
{
  "type": "ihaveobject" ,
  "objectid": "0024839ec9632d382486ba7aac7e0bda3b4bda1d4bd79be9ae78e7e1e813ddd8"
}
```
In the gossiping protocol, whenever a peer receives a new object and validates the object,
then it advertises the new object to its peers.
### Object
This message sends an object from one peer to another. It contains an object key which contains the object in question.
``` json
{
  "type": "object" ,
  "object": {
  "type": "block" ,
  "txids": [
  "740bcfb434c89abe57bb2bc80290cd5495e87ebf8cd0dadb076bc50453590104"
  ] ,
  "nonce": "a26d92800cf58e88a5ecf37156c031a4147c2128beeaf1cca2785c93242a4c8b",
  "previd": "0024839ec9632d382486ba7aac7e0bda3b4bda1d4bd79be9ae78e7e1e813ddd8",
  "created": "1622825642",
  "T": "003a000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
  }
}
```
# Implementation
## Networking
The node and the logic behind it is implemented in python. It is being ran on a virtual machine which is set up using Azure. 
Its public IP is `20.126.29.4`.

## General
Nodes' logic is contained in `barone.py`. It also uses functions from `util` to validate objects or to create message. `client.py` is for testing and communicate with the node. 

## Peers
The node knows a certain number of peers in the blockchain. It has a predefined number of open connections with some of them.
The node only communicates with its connections. Once open connections fall below a threshold, the node performs peer discovery to find new connections.
### Peers database
Peers database is contained within `peers.csv` so that if the node crashes, it still has them. `peers_db.py` manipulates and maintaines the database.

## Objects
Nodes exchange objects between them.
### Objects database
Objects database is contained within `objects.txt`. `objectid` and `object` are separated with one white space.
`objects_db.py` maintaines the objects database.
